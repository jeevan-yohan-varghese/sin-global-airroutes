# Analysis of Global Air Routes

Airports are vital to every country and a major relation between countries is often identified by the number of flights shared among them i.e. how many flights serve as a pathway between the two countries.
In this project we aim to identify the airport in India with the highest relations i.e. cities which travel to and welcome passengers from the majority of states. Apart from this, the global air routes have also been mapped on the world map. We are training the sentiment analysis model using a US dataset.
